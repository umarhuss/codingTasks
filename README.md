# Coding Tasks Repository

Welcome to my Coding Tasks Repository! This is a collection of various coding exercises and projects I've worked on, ranging from fundamental algorithms to more complex tasks. Whether you're looking to explore basic functionalities or dive deep into algorithm implementations, you'll find something interesting here.

## Repository Contents

### 1. Prime Number Calculator
This folder contains a tool that efficiently calculates prime numbers up to a specified limit. It includes:
- **A script to find all prime numbers up to a given number.**
- **An algorithm explanation and its implementation details.**

You can find more information about the prime number calculator in its [README file](Prime-Number-Calculator/README.md).

### 2. Searching Algorithms
This section showcases various searching algorithms, each with its unique approach to finding data:
- **Linear Search**
- **Binary Search**

Each algorithm is implemented with comments and examples to demonstrate their use cases and efficiency.

### 3. Sorting Algorithms
Sorting is a fundamental part of computer science, and this repository includes several sorting methods:
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Merge Sort**

Explore each sorting algorithm's directory for detailed explanations and code implementations.

## How to Use This Repository

To explore the code and run the programs, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coding-tasks.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the Desired Folder:**
   ```bash
   cd coding-tasks
   ```

3. **Run the Programs:**
   Each folder contains its own README file with specific instructions on how to run the scripts and what prerequisites are needed.

## Getting Started

If you're new to this repository, start by browsing through the folders. Each directory is designed to be standalone, meaning you can pick any topic and start exploring without needing to reference other parts of the repository.

For detailed guidance on any specific task, check the README file within that directory. Each README will provide:
- **An overview of the task or algorithm.**
- **Detailed steps on how to use or run the code.**
- **Additional resources for learning more about the topic.**
