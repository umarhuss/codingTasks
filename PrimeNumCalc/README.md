# Prime Number Calculator

## Overview
Welcome to the **Prime Number Calculator**! This project represents my first portfolio piece developed during my software engineering bootcamp. The goal is to provide a straightforward yet powerful tool to find prime numbers within a user-specified range. It highlights:

- User-friendly interaction.
- Clean, logical, and maintainable code.
- Efficient and reusable components.

## Usage
To use the Prime Number Calculator:
1. Open the provided Python script in your favorite Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
2. Execute the script.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the range of numbers you wish to analyze.

The program will compute and display a list of all prime numbers within the specified range.

## Features
- **User Interaction**: The program prompts users to input the range of numbers they want to analyze for prime numbers.
- **Clean and Logical Code**: Designed with readability and maintainability in mind.
- **Reusable Components**: The modular structure allows for easy adaptation and reuse of code in other projects.
- **Efficiency**: Utilizes an efficient algorithm with a linear time complexity of O(n).

## How It Works
The Prime Number Calculator uses a straightforward algorithm to identify prime numbers:
1. It iterates through each number in the specified range.
2. For each number, it checks whether it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.
3. If a number is not divisible by any other number, it is considered prime and added to the list of prime numbers.

## Getting Started
To get started:
1. Download the Python script provided in this repository.
2. Run the script in your Python environment.
3. Follow the prompts to find prime numbers within your chosen range.

```bash
# Example: Running the script in a terminal
python prime_number_calculator.py
```
