# Search and Sort Algorithms

Welcome to the Search and Sort Algorithms section of my Coding Tasks Repository! ðŸŽ‰

This folder contains various examples of search and sort algorithms that I've implemented as part of my learning journey in data structures and algorithms during my bootcamp. These algorithms are crucial in many aspects of computer science and software development.

## Why Learn Search and Sort Algorithms?

Understanding search and sort algorithms is important for several reasons:

- **Efficiency**: These algorithms help optimize the performance of applications by improving how data is searched and organized.
- **Problem-Solving Skills**: They provide foundational techniques that are essential for solving a wide range of computational problems.
- **Foundation for Advanced Topics**: Mastery of these algorithms prepares you for more advanced concepts in computer science.
- **Technical Interviews**: Knowledge of these algorithms is often tested in technical interviews, making them vital for career development.

## Folder Contents

### Searching Algorithms

This section includes implementations of basic searching techniques:
- **Linear Search**: A straightforward method to find an element in a list by checking each item one by one.
- **Binary Search**: A more efficient technique for searching in sorted lists by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

### Sorting Algorithms

Here, you'll find examples of sorting methods used to arrange data in a specific order:
- **Bubble Sort**: A simple algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Selection Sort**: An algorithm that sorts by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted portion and moving it to the sorted portion.
- **Insertion Sort**: A method that builds the final sorted array one item at a time, inserting each new item into its proper place.
- **Merge Sort**: An efficient, stable, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that breaks the list into halves, sorts them, and merges them back together.

Each algorithm's subfolder contains:
- **Source Code**: Clean, well-commented code demonstrating the algorithm.
- **Explanation**: Detailed descriptions of how the algorithm works, its time complexity, and practical applications.
- **Example Usage**: Sample code showing how to use the algorithm in real-world scenarios.

## How to Use This Folder
